Sales Time Has Started In Our Online Store!

January means sales time, so we have been slashing our prices in our online Tictail store, where 100% (!) of all sales proceeds benefit our work. For instance, you can now buy our infamous 'Wrap It Up Before You Fuck It Up' tee by Paul Snowden for ladies (as worn on the main image by the lovely Anouck Lepere in a photo by Marc Lagrange -who recently passed away due to an accident much too young) and our cooler-than-cool DAA Festival tee (for ladies or unisex), as worn by our equally lovely DAA Ambassador Hannelore Knuts here: [http://designersagainstaids.tictail.com/product/daa-festival-t-shirt-unisex ][0]

These T-shirts are made of certified organic cotton, were made Fair Trade and now cost only 30 euros plus shipping.  
In our online store you'll find many more designer goodies, including brands such as Balenciaga, Prada, Marni, Current/Elliott and Rick Owens, handmade boho pieces and other must-haves for great prices- please take a look and thank you already for your support!
