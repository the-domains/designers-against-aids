The last days of December and the first week of January are perfect to reflect, to take stock of what happened last year, what went well and what can be improved upon.

One of my main tasks as creative director, after developing a concept, is to approach fashion houses, brands and celebrities with proposals for collaborations, of the kind that Designers against AIDS -- and to a lesser extent Beauty without Irony- have done with H&M (Fashion against AIDS), Playboy Design, Delvaux, Marc Jacobs, Six Scents Perfumes, Belgian retailer JBC, Eastpak Artist Studio and many others --with some interesting new partners to be revealed for 2016 soon.

The main goal of these projects is always to draw attention to a deserving social issue such as HIV prevention, gender equality, LGBT/human rights, or self confidence among women, while at the same time raising funds for charities who work with these issues and creating collections and campaigns that make all partners look good and that attract media attention, so that we can raise even more awareness, also among young people who don't want to buy the products.

I've been doing this since 15 years now, so I'm not exactly an amateur. Before that I was a well-known fashion editor/writer/consultant for another 15 years, meaning that most people in the fashion world -except on a junior level-know very well who I am.

The thing that annoys me more than anything else when working on developing these projects, is the fact that so many fashion houses and brands just plain ignore the proposals I send to them. How much trouble is it to send back a short mail, saying 'Thanks for the invitation, but we're not interested right now?'

Of course many people do this, but at least as many others don't. Not a peep, not even after a follow-up mail (or 3).

Why is this? Are they too busy (guess what: so am I)? Do they think that our projects are so insignificant that they don't even warrant a 1-sentence reply? Do they get hundreds of these proposals each week, so that mine gets buried underneath the heaps (they wish!)? Are they working on 'more important' things? Are they just 'over' HIV/AIDS?

I have no idea, but I do know that it makes me furious. I reply to each serious email that I receive within a week, as it's just the right, human and decent thing to do- both in my work life and in my private life. Also, this way everybody knows where they stand.

If we want the world to become a better and more beautiful place, it might be a good idea to start right at your desk: by being a good, polite human being.

Wishing all of you a wonderful and inspiring 2016\.
